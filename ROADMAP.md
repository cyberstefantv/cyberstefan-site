# Draft CyberStefan dashboard roadmap

## Ideas

- use Semantic Release for versioning of CyberStefan.com
  - there's a version badge in the navbar, that should increment when a new semantic release is made
  - a semantic release should be made when a pull request gets merged in, or when a commit lands in a certain format
- projects and streams as JSON data files
  - that way we can load projects into lists in React and link them to streams in the dashboard
- interactivity
  - ability to vote on projects? or choose what project to work on in a stream?
