        This website is a dashboard for{" "}
        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cyberstefan">my coding stream</a>. Fairly
        basic right now, but the idea is to keep adding upgrades during the
        stream (and maybe some small tweaks off of it).

      <p>
        You'll find me discussing the progress and take-aways of these projects
        on <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberstefantv">Twitter</a>. Everything
        will be available on GitHub.
